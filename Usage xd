The program manages up to four cameras using OpenCV. At startup, it attempts to initialize video devices with IDs 0 to 3. After launching, it displays the feed of the selected camera and automatically detects motion using BackgroundSubtractorMOG2.

Recording starts automatically when detected motion exceeds the defined threshold and lasts about ten seconds. Video files are saved in AVI format with a timestamp.

Main controls:

“q” to exit the program

“0” to “3” to select the camera

“z” to enable or disable zone monitoring

Zone monitoring divides the frame into four quadrants and reports if motion is detected in any of them.

When exiting, all resources and windows are properly released.
